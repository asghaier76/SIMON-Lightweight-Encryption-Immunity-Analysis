# SIMON-Lightweight-Encryption-Immunity-Analysis

This is repo is a conference paper for a project to implement the SIMON lightweight encryption portocol and study 
its immunity to correlation based attackes and to linear span attack.

SIMON is a NIST devised lightweigh block encryotion with few variants and form with SPECK a family
