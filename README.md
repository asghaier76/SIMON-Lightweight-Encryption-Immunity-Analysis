# SIMON-Lightweight-Encryption-Immunity-Analysis

This repo is a conference paper for a project to implement the SIMON lightweight encryption portocol and study 
its immunity to cross-correlation based attackes and to linear span attack.

SIMON is a NSA devised lightweight block encryotion with few variants and form with SPECK a family 
targeting SW and HW implementations.

Internet of things (IoT) and sensor-based devices are mostly characterized by their limited power and
computing resources. 
However, those devices with small footprints, limited computing capability, low-power and being attached closer 
to humans have hindered their ability to ensure secure and immune performance under cryptographic attacks.
To enable security on those devices under computing and power constraints a number of lightweightcryptography algorithms 
have emerged. The proposed algorithms focus on the design of cryptographic functions that can satisfy the constraints imposed by limited computing capability in wearable devices, RFID tags, and many other IoT and wireless sensing devices.

The paper presents the implementation setup used and the analysis conducted.
